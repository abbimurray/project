In the src folder there is ADD, DELETE,VIEW AND UPDATE pacakages which follow the CRUD format.
For the moment I am using scanner to take in values until i get my GUI to implement these.

UPDATED
Trying to implement model, view, controller etc format
Will place old code which uses terminal into old folder once i get the full system implemented through the gui
